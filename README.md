# Hotel Management Analytics Dashboard
## Project Overview

The **Hotel Management Analytics Dashboard** is a powerful business intelligence tool built using Power BI to provide hotel managers with summary, data-driven insights. The dashboard transforms raw booking and performance data into actionable information, offering an overview of occupancy trends, revenue streams, and customer behavior trends.

---
## Problem Statement

Hotel management involves staying on top of dynamic variables such as evolving booking patterns, seasonal demand, cancellations, and revenue optimization. The majority of hotel managers rely on legacy systems or spreadsheets that lack the capacity to deliver real-time insight, thus leading to missed revenue opportunities and inefficient decision-making.

### Key Challenges Addressed:

- No real-time visibility into occupancy and revenue trends.

- Cannot easily identify peak and off seasons.

- Lack of insight into guest behavior during weekdays versus weekends.
- Ineffective analysis of booking cancellations and revenue leakage.
- No single view for management decision-making.
## Project Goals

- Develop a new, interactive Power BI dashboard with historical booking data.

- Enable granular analysis by day, week, and month.
- Compare booking trends, room utilization, and revenue metrics.
- Enhance forecasting capabilities with visual insights.
